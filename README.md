# Angular18 PWA - Testing Badging API

> Testing the Badging API involves checking how well our application interacts with the API, specifically for managing badges (like notifications) on a userâ€™s device.

> The App Badging API is a new web platform API that allows installed web apps to set an application-wide badge, shown in an operating-system-specific place associated with the application (such as the shelf or home screen).

> `Note`: In order for this demo to work, it must be an installed Progressive Web App. It also requires the Notifications permission on some platforms

```js
ng new Angular18-PWA --routing --style=scss
cd Angular18-PWA

// This will configure the service worker for caching assets,
// manifest.webmanifest file, and icons needed to make our Angular app a PWA
ng add @angular/pwa

// Testing PWA Features
// PWAs rely on service workers and specific configurations that need to be served over HTTPS or a localhost domain
// angular-cli (ng-serve) does not work with service workers
npm i -g http-server

// Serve the Application Locally
// Output location: C:\Users\lanes\dev2\Angular18-PWA\dist\angular18-pwa
ng build --configuration production

## What to Expect

When the component initialises, you should see one of the following messages in the console:

"The Badging API is supported!" if the API is available.
"The Badging API is not supported in this browser." if it is not.
If the badge is successfully set to 123, you should see: "Badge set to 123" in the console.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of our choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
